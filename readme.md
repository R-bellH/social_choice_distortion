# Project Overview

This project provides an implementation of several social choice functions and objectives, as well as a distortion calculation function for the sum of agents' costs objective.
It also includes a skeleton for the optimal randomized mechanism for the α-decisive, 1-Euclidean space.  

The project explores the worst-case distortion for deterministic social choice functions in α-decisive elections and how the distortion changes with the number of agents and candidates. 
It also investigates the effectiveness of distortion for larger voter pools and the challenges it faces for larger numbers of candidates. 


## Installation and Running the Project
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:  

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies. You can do this by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal. This will install all the necessary libraries that are used in this project.
3. Open the all_in_one.ipynb file in your Jupyter notebook environment.
4. Run all the cells in the notebook to see the results.

alternatively you can simply open all_in_one.ipynb and have a look as it already have some information available. 

Please note that this project is developed using Python, and it is recommended to have a basic understanding of Python programming and Jupyter notebooks to fully understand and navigate through the project.

## note
you can also have a look at the pdf files in the project to have a better understanding of the project.
